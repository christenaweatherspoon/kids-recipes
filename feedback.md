# Project 2 Feedback

## Technical Requirements	- Performing

> Full CRUD functionality is present on one or two models .	

Awesome job! You have full CRUD on your model.

## Creativity and Interface	- Performing

> The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS.	

Your app looks really good! I really like the styling.

## Code Quality	- Performing

> Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues	

Really good job here! The only thing I'm seeing is some indentation inconsistencies! I would focus on making sure that everything is consistent there!

## Functionality	- Performing

> Application contains no major errors

Awesome job here! Full CRUD functionality!

## Planning / Process / Submission - Incomplete

> No submission received, or submission does not contain basic documentation of planning (ERD, wireframes, commit history, etc)	

Remember to add a ReadMe and documentation on your planning, wireframes, etc. You have commit history, but no other documentation! Here's an [awesome guide for creating a ReadMe](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3).


## Other Feedback

Awesome job on this project! It looks awesome and fits all the requirements other than the documentation. The project is complete, just would add that in before spotlight!
